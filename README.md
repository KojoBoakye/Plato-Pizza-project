I came across a dataset in a power BI project on twitter which I really wanted to analyse but since I am a beginner in data analysis I haven’t touched power BI yet so I wondered how I can help to use my analytics skill to solve those business questions and to practice my skills in data cleaning, data modelling, analysis and data visualisation all in excel.

The data was about the details of all orders made at the pizza shop in the year 2015

So the only tool I used for this project is excel.

Excel concepts I applied are :

VLOOKUP

SUMIFSCOUNTIFS

Problem Statement

What days and times tend to be busiest at the pizza shop?

What are the best and worst selling pizzas in the shop?

What's the average order value?

How much money did the pizza shop make this year?

Data Sourcing

It contains 4 sheets/tables:

1. ORDER DETAILS with 999+ rows and 4 columns

2. ORDERS with 999+ rows with 3 columns

3. PIZZA TYPES with 33 rows and 4 columns

4. PIZZA with 96 rows and 4 columns

Data modelling

I linked all four tables into one using the VLOOKUP function which I name in a sheet called “all linked”

Data Transformation/Cleaning:

The data was efficiently cleaned and transformed in excel.

Converted price column from decimal to dollar

Group all the order times into hourly ranges.

Calculated revenue generated from each order by multiplying the prize of each pizza with the quantity ordered.

As I keep digging for more insight, I continue to iterate to suit my needs.
